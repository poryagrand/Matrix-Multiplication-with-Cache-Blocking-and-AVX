# Matrix Multiplication (UCSD CSE260 PA1)
In assignment #1, you or you and your partner will use your knowledge of the memory hierarchy and vectorization to optimize a matrix multiply routine.  We will provide you with simple starter code.  Your job is to optimize that starter code to achieve higher performance.  Your multiply routine will be compared to libatlas  (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software - http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net ).  You will optimize your code for maximum performance one one core of an amazon EC2  t2.micro instance.
